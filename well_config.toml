# SAIREN-OS Well Configuration — Tuned for reduced noise

# Only overriding values that differ from defaults.
# Everything else falls back to built-in defaults.
#
# Key changes from defaults:
#   - MSE warning: 70% -> 60% (less sensitive to minor inefficiency)
#   - MSE poor:    50% -> 40% (only flags genuinely bad drilling)
#   - Cooldown:    60s -> 180s (3 min between same-type alerts)
